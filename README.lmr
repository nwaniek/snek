# SNEK - Python Dependency Manager

``snek`` is a minimalistic and hackable dependency manager that allows to
specify targets in spirit similar to Makefiles, but directly within python.

## Use Cases

In data science, we often build pipelines with lots of configuration options.
Yet, most pipelines can be broken down into small functions that compute
artifacts, that are then later recombined in particular manners. Essentially,
such pipelines can be described as a computational graph.
